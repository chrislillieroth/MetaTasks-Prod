# Phase 2: Accounts & Organizations - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the MetaTasks platform rebuild, establishing the foundation for multi-tenant user and organization management.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Models

#### Custom User Model (`apps/accounts/models.py`)
- Extends Django's `AbstractUser`
- Email-based authentication with unique constraint
- Timestamps for created_at and updated_at
- String representation using email

#### Organization Model (`apps/organizations/models.py`)
- Multi-tenant organization structure
- Fields: name, slug (unique, URL-friendly), description, is_active
- Automatic timestamps
- Ordered by name

#### Membership Model (`apps/organizations/models.py`)
- Links users to organizations with roles
- Four role types: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer
- Unique constraint on user-organization pair
- Active/inactive state for soft membership management

### 2. Service Layer (`apps/organizations/services.py`)

Implements business logic following the service pattern:

- **`create_organization()`**: Creates organization with owner membership, auto-generates slugs
- **`add_member()`**: Adds users to organizations with specified roles
- **`remove_member()`**: Removes users from organizations
- **`update_member_role()`**: Updates user roles within organizations

All critical operations use `@transaction.atomic` for data consistency.

### 3. Selector Layer (`apps/organizations/selectors.py`)

Implements query patterns for data retrieval:

- **`get_user_organizations()`**: Returns all organizations a user belongs to
- **`get_organization_members()`**: Returns all members of an organization
- **`get_user_membership()`**: Gets specific membership details
- **`get_user_default_organization()`**: Returns user's first organization
- **`is_organization_owner()`**: Checks owner status
- **`is_organization_admin()`**: Checks admin privileges (owner or admin role)

### 4. Multi-Tenancy Infrastructure

#### Middleware (`apps/common/middleware.py`)
- **`ActiveOrganizationMiddleware`**: Attaches active organization to requests
- Resolution order:
  1. Session key `active_organization_id`
  2. HTTP header `X-Organization-ID`
  3. User's default organization
- Validates user access to requested organization

#### Tenancy Helpers (`apps/common/tenancy.py`)
- **`filter_by_organization()`**: Filters querysets by organization
- **`ensure_organization_access()`**: Validates user access to organizations

### 5. Database Migrations

- **`apps/accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py`**: Creates custom User model
- **`apps/organizations/migrations/0001_initial.py`**: Creates Organization and Membership models

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite

Created 47 passing tests across 4 test modules:

#### `tests/unit/test_accounts.py` (4 tests)
- User creation and validation
- Email uniqueness enforcement
- Superuser creation
- String representation

#### `tests/unit/test_organizations.py` (28 tests)
- Organization and Membership model operations
- All service layer functions (create, add, remove, update)
- All selector queries
- Role-based permission checks
- Edge cases and error handling

#### `tests/unit/test_common.py` (13 tests)
- Middleware organization resolution
- Session, header, and default fallback handling
- User access validation
- Tenancy helper functions

#### `tests/unit/test_phase2_integration.py` (2 tests)
- End-to-end workflow from user creation to organization management
- Multi-tenant isolation and cross-organization scenarios

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ Follows layered architecture (models → services → selectors)
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Services encapsulate business logic
- ✅ Selectors handle complex queries
- ✅ Middleware provides cross-cutting concerns

### Code Quality
- ✅ All tests passing (47/47)
- ✅ Ruff linting clean
- ✅ Type hints throughout (using modern `X | None` syntax)
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Transaction safety on critical operations

### Multi-Tenancy Features
- ✅ Automatic organization context injection via middleware
- ✅ Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- ✅ Organization isolation enforced
- ✅ Default organization selection
- ✅ Session and header-based organization switching

## Success Criteria Met ✅

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Organization
```python
from apps.organizations import services

org = services.create_organization(
    name="Acme Corporation",
    description="Our company",
    owner=user,
)
```

### Adding Team Members
```python
services.add_member(
    organization=org,
    user=new_user,
    role=Membership.Role.ADMIN,
)
```

### Querying Organizations
```python
from apps.organizations import selectors

# Get user's organizations
orgs = selectors.get_user_organizations(user)

# Check permissions
is_admin = selectors.is_organization_admin(user, org)
```

### Multi-Tenancy in Views
```python
def my_view(request):
    # Middleware attaches active_org to request
    org = request.active_org
    
    # Filter data by organization
    items = filter_by_organization(Item.objects.all(), org)
    return items
```

## Next Steps

Ready for **Phase 3: Licensing Core**:
- Plan/Usage models
- License enforcement service
- Feature guard decorator
- Usage metrics tracking

## Notes

- All implementation follows Django best practices
- Service pattern separates business logic from models
- Selector pattern keeps complex queries organized
- Multi-tenancy is enforced at middleware level
- Role-based permissions ready for future features
- Migrations are SQLite-compatible for tests
- Code is production-ready and fully tested
